/**
 * This timeout uses a background thread to take action exactly when the timeout occurs. Use this to
 * implement timeouts where they aren't supported natively, such as to sockets that are blocked on
 * writing.
 *
 * Subclasses should override [timedOut] to take action when a timeout occurs. This method will be
 * invoked by the shared watchdog thread so it should not do any long-running operations. Otherwise
 * we risk starving other timeouts from being triggered.
 *
 * Use [sink] and [source] to apply this timeout to a stream. The returned value will apply the
 * timeout to each operation on the wrapped stream.
 *
 * Callers should call [enter] before doing work that is subject to timeouts, and [exit] afterwards.
 * The return value of [exit] indicates whether a timeout was triggered. Note that the call to
 * [timedOut] is asynchronous, and may be called after [exit].
