/**
 * A source and a sink that are attached. The sink's output is the source's input. Typically each
 * is accessed by its own thread: a producer thread writes data to the sink and a consumer thread
 * reads data from the source.
 *
 * This class uses a buffer to decouple source and sink. This buffer has a user-specified maximum
 * size. When a producer thread outruns its consumer the buffer fills up and eventually writes to
 * the sink will block until the consumer has caught up. Symmetrically, if a consumer outruns its
 * producer reads block until there is data to be read. Limits on the amount of time spent waiting
 * for the other party can be configured with [timeouts][Timeout] on the source and the
 * sink.
 *
 * When the sink is closed, source reads will continue to complete normally until the buffer has
 * been exhausted. At that point reads will return -1, indicating the end of the stream. But if the
 * source is closed first, writes to the sink will immediately fail with an [IOException].
 *
 * A pipe may be canceled to immediately fail writes to the sink and reads from the source.
