/**
 * A sink that uses [DEFLATE](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951) to
 * compress data written to another source.
 *
 * ### Sync flush
 *
 * Aggressive flushing of this stream may result in reduced compression. Each
 * call to [flush] immediately compresses all currently-buffered data;
 * this early compression may be less effective than compression performed
 * without flushing.
 *
 * This is equivalent to using [Deflater] with the sync flush option.
 * This class does not offer any partial flush mechanism. For best performance,
 * only call [flush] when application behavior requires it.
