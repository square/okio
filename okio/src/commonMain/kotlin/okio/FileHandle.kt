/**
 * An open file for reading and writing; using either streaming and random access.
 *
 * Use [read] and [write] to perform one-off random-access reads and writes. Use [source], [sink],
 * and [appendingSink] for streaming reads and writes.
 *
 * File handles must be closed when they are no longer needed. It is an error to read, write, or
 * create streams after a file handle is closed. The operating system resources held by a file
 * handle will be released once the file handle **and** all of its streams are closed.
 *
 * Although this class offers both reading and writing APIs, file handle instances may be
 * read-only or write-only. For example, a handle to a file on a read-only file system will throw an
 * exception if a write is attempted.
 *
 * File handles may be used by multiple threads concurrently. But the individual sources and sinks
 * produced by a file handle are not safe for concurrent use.
