 * source if needed and copying out of the internal buffer of the upstream source if possible.
 *
 * This source also maintains a snapshot of the starting location of the upstream buffer which it
 * validates against on every read. If the upstream buffer is read from, this source will become
 * invalid and throw [IllegalStateException] on any future reads.
