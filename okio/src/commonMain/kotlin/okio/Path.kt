/**
 * A hierarchical address on a file system. A path is an identifier only; a [FileSystem] is required
 * to access the file that a path refers to, if any.
 *
 * UNIX and Windows Paths
 * ----------------------
 *
 * Paths follow different rules on UNIX vs. Windows operating systems. On UNIX operating systems
 * (including Linux, Android, macOS, and iOS), the `/` slash character separates path segments. On
 * Windows, the `\` backslash character separates path segments. The two platforms each have their
 * own rules for path resolution. This class implements all rules on all platforms; for example you
 * can model a Linux path in a native Windows application.
 *
 * Absolute and Relative Paths
 * ---------------------------
 *
 * * **Absolute paths** identify a location independent of any working directory. On UNIX, absolute
 *   paths are prefixed with a slash, `/`. On Windows, absolute paths are one of two forms. The
 *   first is a volume letter, a colon, and a backslash, like `C:\`. The second is called a
 *   Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path, and it is prefixed by two backslashes `\\`. The term
 *   ‘fully-qualified path’ is a synonym of ‘absolute path’.
 *
 * * **Relative paths** are everything else. On their own, relative paths do not identify a
 *   location on a file system; they are relative to the system's current working directory. Use
 *   [FileSystem.canonicalize] to convert a relative path to its absolute path on a particular
 *   file system.
 *
 * There are some special cases when working with relative paths.
 *
 * On Windows, each volume (like `A:\` and `C:\`) has its own current working directory. A path
 * prefixed with a volume letter and colon but no slash (like `A:letter.doc`) is relative to the
 * working directory on the named volume. For example, if the working directory on `A:\` is
 * `A:\jesse`, then the path `A:letter.doc` resolves to `A:\jesse\letter.doc`.
 *
 * The path string `C:\Windows` is an absolute path when following Windows rules and a relative
 * path when following UNIX rules. For example, if the current working directory is
 * `/Users/jesse`, then `C:\Windows` resolves to `/Users/jesse/C:/Windows`.
 *
 * This class decides which rules to follow by inspecting the first slash character in the path
 * string. If the path contains no slash characters, it uses the host platform's rules. Or you may
 * explicitly specify which rules to use by specifying the `directorySeparator` parameter in
 * [toPath]. Pass `"/"` to get UNIX rules and `"\"` to get Windows rules.
 *
 * Path Traversal
 * --------------
 *
 * After the optional path root (like `/` on UNIX, like `X:\` or `\\` on Windows), the remainder of
 * the path is a sequence of segments separated by `/` or `\` characters. Segments satisfy these
 * rules:
 *
 *  * Segments are always non-empty.
 *  * If the segment is `.`, then the full path must be `.`.
 *  * If the segment is `..`, then the the path must be relative. All `..` segments precede all
 *    other segments.
 *
 * The only path that ends with `/` is the file system root, `/`. The dot path `.` is a relative
 * path that resolves to whichever path it is resolved against.
 *
 * The [name] is the last segment in a path. It is typically a file or directory name, like
 * `README.md` or `Desktop`. The name may be another special value:
 *
 *  * The empty string is the name of the file system root path (full path `/`).
 *  * `.` is the name of the identity relative path (full path `.`).
 *  * `..` is the name of a path consisting of only `..` segments (such as `../../..`).
 *
 * Comparing Paths
 * ---------------
 *
 * Path implements [Comparable], [equals], and [hashCode]. If two paths are equal then they operate
 * on the same file on the file system.
 *
 * Note that the converse is not true: **if two paths are non-equal, they may still resolve to the
 * same file on the file system.** Here are some of the ways non-equal paths resolve to the same
 * file:
 *
 *  * **Case differences.** The default file system on macOS is case-insensitive. The paths
 *    `/Users/jesse/notes.txt` and `/USERS/JESSE/NOTES.TXT` are non-equal but these paths resolve to
 *    the same file.
 *  * **Mounting differences.** Volumes may be mounted at multiple paths. On macOS,
 *    `/Users/jesse/notes.txt`  and `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/jesse/notes.txt` typically resolve
 *    to the same file. On Windows, `C:\project\notes.txt` and `\\localhost\c$\project\notes.txt`
 *    typically resolve to the same file.
 *  * **Hard links.** UNIX file systems permit multiple paths to refer for same file. The paths may
 *    be wildly different, like `/Users/jesse/bruce_wayne.vcard` and
 *    `/Users/jesse/batman.vcard`, but changes via either path are reflected in both.
 *  * **Symlinks.** Symlinks permit multiple paths and directories to refer to the same file. On
 *     macOS `/tmp` is symlinked to `/private/tmp`, so `/tmp/notes.txt` and `/private/tmp/notes.txt`
 *     resolve to the same file.
 *
 * To test whether two paths refer to the same file, try [FileSystem.canonicalize] first. This
 * follows symlinks and looks up the preserved casing for case-insensitive case-preserved paths.
 * **This method does not guarantee a unique result, however.** For example, each hard link to a
 * file may return its own canonical path.
 *
 * Paths are sorted in case-sensitive order.
 *
