/**
 * Description of a file or another object referenced by a path.
 *
 * In simple use a file system is a mechanism for organizing files and directories on a local
 * storage device. In practice file systems are more capable and their contents more varied. For
 * example, a path may refer to:
 *
 *  * An operating system process that consumes data, produces data, or both. For example, reading
 *    from the `/dev/urandom` file on Linux returns a unique sequence of pseudorandom bytes to each
 *    reader.
 *
 *  * A stream that connects a pair of programs together. A pipe is a special file that a producing
 *    program writes to and a consuming program reads from. Both programs operate concurrently. The
 *    size of a pipe is not well defined: the writer can write as much data as the reader is able to
 *    read.
 *
 *  * A file on a remote file system. The performance and availability of remote files may be quite
 *    different from that of local files!
 *
 *  * A symbolic link (symlink) to another path. When attempting to access this path the file system
 *    will follow the link and return data from the target path.
 *
 *  * The same content as another path without a symlink. On UNIX file systems an inode is an
 *    anonymous handle to a file's content, and multiple paths may target the same inode without any
 *    other relationship to one another. A consequence of this design is that a directory with three
 *    1 GiB files may only need 1 GiB on the storage device.
 *
 * This class does not attempt to model these rich file system features! It exposes a limited view
 * useful for programs with only basic file system needs. Be cautious of the potential consequences
 * of special files when writing programs that operate on a file system.
 *
 * File metadata is subject to change, and code that operates on file systems should defend against
 * changes to the file that occur between reading metadata and subsequent operations.
