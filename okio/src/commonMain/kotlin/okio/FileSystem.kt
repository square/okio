/**
 * Read and write access to a hierarchical collection of files, addressed by [paths][Path]. This
 * is a natural interface to the current computer's local file system.
 *
 * Other implementations are possible:
 *
 *  * `FakeFileSystem` is an in-memory file system suitable for testing. Note that this class is
 *    included in the `okio-fakefilesystem` artifact.
 *
 *  * [ForwardingFileSystem] is a file system decorator. Use it to apply monitoring, encryption,
 *    compression, or filtering to another file system.
 *
 *  * A ZIP file system could provide access to the contents of a `.zip` file.
 *
 * For improved capability and testability, consider structuring your classes to dependency inject
 * a `FileSystem` rather than using `FileSystem.SYSTEM` directly.
 *
 * Small API
 * ---------
 *
 * This interface is deliberately limited in which features it supports.
 *
 * It is not suitable for high-latency or unreliable remote file systems. It lacks support for
 * retries, timeouts, cancellation, and bulk operations.
 *
 * It cannot create special file types like hard links, pipes, or mounts. Reading or writing these
 * files works as if they were regular files.
 *
 * It cannot read or write file access control features like the UNIX `chmod` and Windows access
 * control lists. It does honor these controls and will fail with an [IOException] if privileges
 * are insufficient!
 *
 * It cannot lock files or check which files are locked.
 *
 * It cannot watch the file system for changes.
 *
 * Applications that need rich file system features should use another API!
 *
 * Multiplatform
 * -------------
 *
 * This class supports a matrix of Kotlin platforms (JVM, Kotlin/Native, Kotlin/JS) and operating
 * systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows). It attempts to balance working similarly across platforms
 * with being consistent with the local operating system.
 *
 * This is a blocking API which limits its applicability on concurrent Node.js services. File
 * operations will block the event loop (and all JavaScript execution!) until they complete.
 *
 * It supports the path schemes of both Windows (like `C:\Users`) and UNIX (like `/home`). Note that
 * path resolution rules differ by platform.
 *
 * Differences vs. Java IO APIs
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * The `java.io.File` class is Java's original file system API. The `delete` and `renameTo` methods
 * return false if the operation failed. The `list` method returns null if the file isn't a
 * directory or could not be listed. This class always throws an [IOException] when an operation
 * doesn't succeed.
 *
 * The `java.nio.file.Path` and `java.nio.file.Files` classes are the entry points of Java's new file system
 * API. Each `Path` instance is scoped to a particular file system, though that is often implicit
 * because the `Paths.get()` function automatically uses the default (ie. system) file system.
 * In Okio's API paths are just identifiers; you must use a specific `FileSystem` object to do
 * I/O with.
 *
 * Closeable
 * ---------
 *
 * Implementations of this interface may need to be closed to release resources.
 *
 * It is the file system implementor's responsibility to document whether a file system instance
 * must be closed, and what happens to its open streams when the file system is closed. For example,
 * the Java NIO FileSystem closes all of its open streams when the file system is closed.
 *
 * The built-in `FileSystem.SYSTEM` implementation does not need to be closed and closing it has no
 * effect.

   * used to move a file or a directory.
   *
   * **Only as Atomic as the Underlying File System Supports**
   *
   * FAT and NTFS file systems cannot atomically move a file over an existing file. If the target
   * file already exists, the move is performed into two steps:
   *
   *  1. Atomically delete the target file.
   *  2. Atomically rename the source file to the target file.

   * crashes, the host operating system crashes, or the hardware fails it is possible that the
   * delete step will succeed and the rename will not.
   *
   * **Entire-file or nothing**
   *
   * These are the possible results of this operation:
   *
   *  * This operation returns normally, the source file is absent, and the target file contains the
   *    data previously held by the source file. This is the success case.
   *
   *  * The operation throws an [IOException] and the file system is unchanged. For example, this
   *    occurs if this process lacks permissions to perform the move.
   *
   *  * This operation throws an [IOException], the target file is deleted, but the source file is
   *    unchanged. This is the partial failure case described above and is only possible on
   *    file systems like FAT and NTFS that do not support atomic file replacement. Typically in
   *    such cases this operation won't return at all because the process or operating system has
   *    also crashed.
   *
   * There is no failure mode where the target file holds a subset of the bytes of the source file.
   * If the rename step cannot be performed atomically, this function will throw an [IOException]
   * before attempting a move. Typically this occurs if the source and target files are on different
   * physical volumes.
   *
