 * A segment of a buffer.
 *
 * Each segment in a buffer is a circularly-linked list node referencing the following and
 * preceding segments in the buffer.
 *
 * Each segment in the pool is a singly-linked list node referencing the rest of segments in the
 * pool.
 *
 * The underlying byte arrays of segments may be shared between buffers and byte strings. When a
 * segment's byte array is shared the segment may not be recycled, nor may its byte data be changed.
 * The lone exception is that the owner segment is allowed to append to the segment, writing data at
 * `limit` and beyond. There is a single owning segment for each byte array. Positions,
 * limits, prev, and next references are not shared.
