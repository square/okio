/**
 * Supplies a stream of bytes. Use this interface to read data from wherever it's located: from the
 * network, storage, or a buffer in memory. Sources may be layered to transform supplied data, such
 * as to decompress, decrypt, or remove protocol framing.
 *
 * Most applications shouldn't operate on a source directly, but rather on a [BufferedSource] which
 * is both more efficient and more convenient. Use [buffer] to wrap any source with a buffer.
 *
 * Sources are easy to test: just use a [Buffer] in your tests, and fill it with the data your
 * application is to read.
