/**
 * A policy on how much time to spend on a task before giving up. When a task
 * times out, it is left in an unspecified state and should be abandoned. For
 * example, if reading from a source times out, that source should be closed and
 * the read should be retried later. If writing to a sink times out, the same
 * rules apply: close the sink and retry later.
 *
 * <h3>Timeouts and Deadlines</h3>
 * This class offers two complementary controls to define a timeout policy.
 *
 * <p><strong>Timeouts</strong> specify the maximum time to wait for a single
 * operation to complete. Timeouts are typically used to detect problems like
 * network partitions. For example, if a remote peer doesn't return <i>any</i>
 * data for ten seconds, we may assume that the peer is unavailable.
 *
 * <p><strong>Deadlines</strong> specify the maximum time to spend on a job,
 * composed of one or more operations. Use deadlines to set an upper bound on
 * the time invested on a job. For example, a battery-conscious app may limit
 * how much time it spends pre-loading content.
