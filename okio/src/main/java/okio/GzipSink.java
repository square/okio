 * A sink that uses <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt">GZIP</a> to
 * compress written data to another sink.
 *
 * <h3>Sync flush</h3>
 * Aggressive flushing of this stream may result in reduced compression. Each
 * call to {@link #flush} immediately compresses all currently-buffered data;
 * this early compression may be less effective than compression performed
 * without flushing.
 *
 * <p>This is equivalent to using {@link Deflater} with the sync flush option.
 * This class does not offer any partial flush mechanism. For best performance,
 * only call {@link #flush} when application behavior requires it.
