Okio
====

Okio is a library that complements `java.io` and `java.nio` to make it much
easier to access, store, and process your data. It started as a component of
[OkHttp][1], the capable HTTP client included in Android. It's well-exercised
and ready to solve new problems.

ByteStrings and Buffers
-----------------------

Okio is built around two types that pack a lot of capability into a
straightforward API:

 * [**ByteString**][3] is an immutable sequence of bytes. For character data, `String`
   is fundamental. `ByteString` is String's long-lost brother, making it easy to
   treat binary data as a value. This class is ergonomic: it knows how to encode
   and decode itself as hex, base64, and UTF-8.

 * [**Buffer**][4] is a mutable sequence of bytes. Like `ArrayList`, you don't need
   to size your buffer in advance. You read and write buffers as a queue: write
   data to the end and read it from the front. There's no obligation to manage
   positions, limits, or capacities.

Internally, `ByteString` and `Buffer` do some clever things to save CPU and
memory. If you encode a UTF-8 string as a `ByteString`, it caches a reference to
that string so that if you decode it later, there's no work to do.

`Buffer` is implemented as a linked list of segments. When you move data from
one buffer to another, it _reassigns ownership_ of the segments rather than
copying the data across. This approach is particularly helpful for multithreaded
programs: a thread that talks to the network can exchange data with a worker
thread without any copying or ceremony.

Sources and Sinks
-----------------

An elegant part of the `java.io` design is how streams can be layered for
transformations like encryption and compression. Okio includes its own stream
types called [`Source`][5] and [`Sink`][6] that work like `InputStream` and
`OutputStream`, but with some key differences:

 * **Timeouts.** The streams provide access to the timeouts of the underlying
   I/O mechanism. Unlike the `java.io` socket streams, both `read()` and
   `write()` calls honor timeouts.

 * **Easy to implement.** `Source` declares three methods: `read()`, `close()`,
   and `timeout()`. There are no hazards like `available()` or single-byte reads
   that cause correctness and performance surprises.

 * **Easy to use.** Although _implementations_ of `Source` and `Sink` have only
   three methods to write, _callers_ are given a rich API with the
   [`BufferedSource`][7] and [`BufferedSink`][8] interfaces. These interfaces give you
   everything you need in one place.

 * **No artificial distinction between byte streams and char streams.** It's all
   data. Read and write it as bytes, UTF-8 strings, big-endian 32-bit integers,
   little-endian shorts; whatever you want. No more `InputStreamReader`!

 * **Easy to test.** The `Buffer` class implements both `BufferedSource` and
   `BufferedSink` so your test code is simple and clear.

Sources and sinks interoperate with `InputStream` and `OutputStream`. You can
view any `Source` as an `InputStream`, and you can view any `InputStream` as a
`Source`. Similarly for `Sink` and `OutputStream`.

and three libraries written with it.

[Decoding the Secrets of Binary Data][encoding_talk] ([slides][encoding_slides]): How data encoding
works and how Okio does it.

[Ok Multiplatform!][ok_multiplatform_talk] ([slides][ok_multiplatform_slides]): How we changed
Okio’s implementation language from Java to Kotlin.

[Nerding Out On Okio][apis_talk]: The story of the Okio APIs, their design and tradeoffs, as well
as implementation notes with animated marbles diagrams.


Requirements
------------

Okio 2.x supports Android 4.0.3+ (API level 15+) and Java 7+.

Okio 3.x supports Android 4.0.3+ (API level 15+) and Java 8+.

Okio depends on the [Kotlin standard library][kotlin]. It is a small library with strong
backward-compatibility.
