/**
 * A fully in-memory file system useful for testing. It includes features to support writing
 * better tests.
 *
 * Use [openPaths] to see which paths have been opened for read or write, but not yet closed. Tests
 * should call [checkNoOpenFiles] in `tearDown()` to confirm that no file streams were leaked.
 *
 * Strict By Default
 * -----------------
 *
 * These actions are not allowed and throw an [IOException] if attempted:
 *
 *  * Moving a file that is currently open for reading or writing.
 *  * Deleting a file that is currently open for reading or writing.
 *  * Moving a file to a path that currently resolves to an empty directory.
 *  * Reading and writing the same file at the same time.
 *  * Opening a file for writing that is already open for writing.
 *
 * Programs that do not attempt any of the above operations should work fine on both UNIX and
 * Windows systems. Relax these constraints individually or call [emulateWindows] or [emulateUnix];
 * to apply the constraints of a particular operating system.
 *
 * Closeable
 * ---------
 *
 * This file system cannot be used after it is closed. Closing it does not close any of its open
 * streams; those must be closed directly.
